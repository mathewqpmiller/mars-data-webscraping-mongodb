# mars-data-webscraping-mongodb
This project demonstrates the use of web scraping techniques to collect and analyze data from various Mars-related sources, leveraging MongoDB for data storage. The project was built using Python libraries like BeautifulSoup, Splinter, and Pandas to scrape key information about Mars.

1. Markdown Cells: Use markdown cells to write descriptions, explanations, and comments as you progress through the project. This helps make your notebook more readable and organized.
2. Testing and Debugging: You can test different parts of the project in separate cells. For example, test the request, check for redirects, inspect the raw HTML, etc. Then, debug it step by step.
3. Visualizing Data: Once you extract and clean your data, you can use libraries like matplotlib, seaborn, or plotly to visualize any data or trends. You can create different cells for the visualization portion of the project.
4. Creating the Web App: Once your scraping is working fine, you can use frameworks like Flask or Dash to build your web app within the same notebook environment.

Example Notebook Structure:
Cell 1: Import Libraries (requests, BeautifulSoup)
Cell 2: Define the scrape_nasa_news() function
Cell 3: Call the function to scrape and display the data
Cell 4: Process or Clean the scraped data if needed
Cell 5: Visualize or perform additional analyses
Cell 6: Add Flask/Dash code for the web app (when ready)

By structuring your project in Jupyter Notebook this way, you can keep the workflow smooth and easy to debug.
